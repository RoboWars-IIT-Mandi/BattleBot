- Replace RS775 with BLDC while keeping the same gearbox. Check curves for BLDC about speed and torque and power to see if its viable
- Voltage double pe rpm double? Basically check the curves for BLDC while varying voltage
- Brushed esc ki rating kaise dekhte jab voltage double ho jaata, like since rpm double ho rahi, current utna hi rahega kya?(all while Power double ho rahi) and kya esc ki Watt limitation hoti? ki bas current limitation hoti jisse power limitation aati (Power = V * I )?
- Nayi ESC ka budget hai? and nayi 24V battery(ies) ka? motor to sahi hai RS7775 waali, and RPM bhi agar 24V pe chala rahe, and current bhi typically utna jyaada hoga nahi as Stall current 30A hai, rated current kuch 13A hi hai.

Would cytron motor drivers work?
