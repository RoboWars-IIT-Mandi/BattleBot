READ MORE

**Drums** are vertical spinning weapons, usually cylindrical in shape. The first *[Robot Wars](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Robot_Wars "Robot Wars")* competitors to be equipped with them were [Suicidal Tendencies](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies "Suicidal Tendencies"), [Blade](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Blade "Blade") and [Challenger 2](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Challenger "Challenger"), all of which appeared in Series 3.

Despite their popularity in domestic and international live events, especially those held in the USA, drums were uncommon in the original run of *Robot Wars*, with the most notable examples including Dutch Series 1 champion [Slicer](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Slicer "Slicer"), and the UK Series 6 champion [Tornado](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"). Drums were more popular in the reboot, being used to great success by the robots of [Team Ranglebots](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Ranglebots "Team Ranglebots") and Series 9 Grand Finalist [Concussion](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion "Concussion").

## Definition

**Drum spinners** are usually cylindrically-shaped weapons thicker than [vertical flywheels](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_flywheels "Vertical flywheels"), which cover a wider surface area than a conventional disc. The outer circumference often featured barbs, blades or sharp teeth, with the purpose of grinding, tearing and/or flipping opponents over. Every *Robot Wars* competitor armed with these had the drum mounted vertically, though [horizontal drums](https://battlebots.fandom.com/wiki/Malice "w:c:battlebots:Malice") have appeared in other robot combat shows and events.

Drums can be built in a variety of shapes and sizes, from the narrow disc-like drum of [Tornado](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"), to wider steamroller-like weapons like [Slicer's](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Slicer "Slicer"), or even full-bodied drums in the case of the [Barber-ous](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barber-ous "Barber-ous") series of robots. Some roboteers turn narrower drums into **driscs**, so-called because they have vertical flywheels with a drum in-between, as seen with [Pulsar](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") and [Magnetar](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Magnetar "Magnetar").

Along with custom-built weapons, drums could also be made out of any cylindrical object, a practice especially common in the Classic Series. For example, [Blade's](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Blade "Blade") drum consisted of lawnmower blades attached to the weapon.

A variation on the drum spinner, the **egg beater** (also **eggbeater**, also formerly called **thresher**), was used by [Hobgoblin](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hobgoblin "Hobgoblin") in Series 9 and 10, and is a popular weapon type in other UK and international robot combat events. Robots with egg beaters are also called 'beater bots', and the weapon itself functions identically to a conventional drum. Egg beaters differ in that the weapon consists of a solid, rectangular bar with a hollow centre to save weight, giving the bar a resemblance to an egg whisk, hence the name.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**

![Terrorhurtz vs sabretooth 2](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terrorhurtz_vs_sabretooth_2.jpg)

Sabretooth rips Terrorhurtz's rear stabilisers off

![Magnetar vs Expulsion](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Magnetar_vs_Expulsion.jpg)

Magnetar throws Expulsion into somersaults

![Barberous kat 3](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/robotwars/images/6/6d/Barberous_kat_3.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20190918175343)

The full-body drum design of Barber-ous 2 allowed the weapon to double as the robot's armour

- Drums are generally sturdy, as they are usually constructed from a single block of metal, making them hard to break.
- As with [vertical flywheels](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_flywheels "Vertical flywheels"), drums can allow a robot to remain stable while attacking opponents. This enables them to inflict several quick attacks in succession and 'churn' away at opponents upon making sustained contact with them. [Sabretooth](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sabretooth "Sabretooth") was able to cause extensive damage to the armour of [TMHWK](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tomahawk "Tomahawk") and [Terrorhurtz](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terrorhurtz "Terrorhurtz") in Series 9, while [Pulsar](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") immobilised [Beast](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Beast "Beast") in Series 8 with two hits landed within seconds of each other.
- Drums are capable of launching opponents into the air or flipping them over completely. Slicer, [Barber-ous](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barber-ous "Barber-ous"), Pulsar, [Concussion](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Concussion "Concussion") and [Magnetar](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Magnetar "Magnetar") were especially effective at this.
- With the use of a reversible speed controller, some spinning drums could work in both directions and still be effective even if the robot was inverted.
- The drum can easily be incorporated into an invertible design, as proven by [Tornado](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tornado "Tornado"), Slicer, the Series 8 Pulsar, the Series 3 version of [Suicidal Tendencies](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Suicidal_Tendencies "Suicidal Tendencies") and, in the most extreme case, Barber-ous.
- The generally wider proportions of a vertical drum enable a greater attack range in this orientation, compared to a typical vertical flywheel or bar spinner.
	- A full-bodied drum could also offer the robot a similar degree of protection to a full-body spinner, acting as both the robot's weapon and armour. Barber-ous's drum was the only one to possess this capability.
- While presenting control issues while turning (see Disadvantages), the gyroscopic forces of a drum could allow robots equipped with them to [self-right](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Self-righting_mechanism "Self-righting mechanism") depending on their design. The flat, invertible designs of Concussion and Sabretooth enabled both robots to achieve this feat during testing ahead of Series 10 and the first episode of *[Robot Wars: World Series](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Robot_Wars:_World_Series "Robot Wars: World Series")* respectively. However, Concussion could not emulate this in its Heat Final against [Nuts 2](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Nuts "Nuts") as a result of the [polycarbonate](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Plastic_armour "Plastic armour") 'Nut Busters' added to protect its wheels.

**Disadvantages**

![Barber-ous vs leveler 2](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/robotwars/images/1/12/Barber-ous_vs_leveler_2.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20240504215825)

A powerful blow by Barber-ous 2'n a Bit carried enough recoil to immobilise itself and end its run

![Pulsar Gyrodance](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/robotwars/images/6/63/Pulsar_Gyrodance.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20250104165324)

After losing drive to one side against Ironside3, Pulsar used the gyroscopic forces of its drum to display signs of mobility

![Broken drum](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/robotwars/images/7/79/Broken_drum.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/180?cb=20170306001347)

Sabretooth's drum sustained severe damage following its battle against Terrorhurtz

- Larger and more powerful drums tend to consume high amounts of energy, in some cases reducing their capacity to spin for prolonged periods of time. [Slicer](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Slicer "Slicer") noticeably rationed its drum usage in every battle it fought in, as did the Series 9 Pulsar in an effort to mitigate its reliability issues.
- As with other heavy spinning weapons, the recoil from a drum's impact could cause the robot to do damage to itself, or even immobilise it completely. This cost [Barber-ous 2'n a Bit](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Barber-ous "Barber-ous") in Series 7 when the recoil from its drum shattered its outrigger, causing its removable link to detach despite dominating its first round battle.
- If not built or mounted properly, the drum could either be ripped or broken off completely. This was best shown in Clawed Hopper's battle with Pussycat, where Pussycat sliced off one of Clawed Hopper's side drums.
- Like [vertical flywheels](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Vertical_flywheels "Vertical flywheels"), more powerful drums can also cause the robot to encounter control issues and lift onto one side while turning, due to the gyroscopic forces acting upon the robot while the weapon is spinning. However, these issues are considerably less pronounced in drums than in vertical flywheels, due to their lower moment of inertia (MOI). [Pulsar](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pulsar "Pulsar") notably displayed this characteristic during its Head-to-Head battle against [Ironside3](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ironside3 "Ironside3") in Series 9, using its drum to lift itself onto one wheel in an attempt to show mobility after losing drive to one side.
- While generally durable, it is still possible for drums to become damaged following prolonged contact with or direct attacks from opponents. If this was to occur, drums are challenging to repair due to them generally being constructed from a single part. Sabretooth in particular lost a large chunk of its drum during its Series 9 battle against [Terrorhurtz](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Terrorhurtz "Terrorhurtz"), which required [Team Legion](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Legion "Team Legion") to make substantial repairs to it for the remainder of its Head-to-Head battles.
- Drums are extremely difficult to make, as they require extensive milling and manufacturing. Concussion's drum, a single-toothed design, took 30 hours just to mill at the hands of the very experienced [Simon Scott](https://robotwars.fandom.com/wiki/Team_Razer "Team Razer").[^1]
