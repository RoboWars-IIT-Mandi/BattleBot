Combat robots have been entertaining and amusing since before they were popular on Comedy Central. A while back I undertook the challenge of building a couple of combat robots (a 30lb and a 220lb). Regardless of the size of the machine the steps in the process are the same. This Instructable will walk you through the steps and provide you with resources to help with the machine and give an understanding of what is involved using my 30lb robot as an example.

## Step 2: Do Some Research and Set a Budget.

The first step to building a bot is to think about what kind you would want to build. When I start the project I always take a look at what people have done already and draw from the knowledge learned by others over time.  
  
A good place to start with your research is the builders database. [http://www.buildersdb.com](http://www.buildersdb.com/) this website is used by most competitions for registration. One of the requirements of this site is each team/robot have a profile with a picture of their bots. Because of this you can easily browse hundreds of other robots in your weight class.  
  
Anther good starting point is to determine how much money you are willing to invest. Unless you have lots of parts hanging around which can be re-used from other projects you will need to account for ever item from motors to materials and don't forget about the machining/ building time. Below is a list of the components commonly required for most combat robots.  
  
The main reason that setting a budget is important for your project is that you can very easily spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars very quickly. Robotics is a fun hobby and can fit any budget if you plan for it. The last thing anyone wants is to get part of the way into the build and then not be able to finish due to funds.  
  
Common components:  
\*Drive motors/ transmissions  
\*wheels  
\*chassis materials  
\*weapon motor  
\*speed controllers for each motor  
\*radio control system (receiver and transmitter)  
\*batteries  
\*wire  
\*main power switch  
\*Bearings  
\*shafts and axles  
\*screws and fasteners  
\*armor material  
\*weapon (material or purchase)  
  
It is also important not to forget spare parts, as during combat you will break parts and components. Also having at least 2 sets of batteries will be necessary for competition  

## Step 3: Initial Design

![Initial Design](https://content.instructables.com/F9L/NGOU/FIQAL6IQ/F9LNGOUFIQAL6IQ.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&fit=bounds&md=MjAxMy0xMi0xMCAwNjozMTowNi4w)

Initial Design

it all starts with a few sketches and a few different concepts. I always do a few concepts and some initial layouts so that I can make a determination as to the best design. Also the more layout is done before the final design the easier to transition to computer design for machining.  
  
It is one of my personal rules that when I start thinking about a design I look for robots that have done similar things and try to see what was successful and what wasn't so I can always improve on the design concept.  
  
I try and keep two things in my mind at all times:  
1)Is this robot unique from others? Does it have that wow factor, and will I be happy with it as a personal product as well as how competitive it might be  
  
2) How easy will it be to maintain. Does changing a fried motor require the complete dis-assembly of the robot? Can I change parts out in 10-15 mins if needed?  
  
Those two key concepts help focus your thoughts when thinking about your bot. Also make sure that you check the rules for the competition you are thinking about. Most events use the rules governed by the Robot Fighting League (http://www.botleague.net/ ), but some organizations such as Battlebots ( [http://www.battlebots.com](http://www.battlebots.com/) ) have some different rules. These rule sets will dictate the types of machines you can build and how to make them safe.  
  
The last part of the initial design is to figure out what parts you have that might work and do a quick layout of your basic overall dimensions, with weight limits for each subsystem. The more planning you do at this stage will help along the way.

## Step 6: Construction of Manufactured Parts

![Construction of Manufactured Parts](https://content.instructables.com/FHS/H1CQ/FIJ3YDUM/FHSH1CQFIJ3YDUM.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=600&fit=bounds&md=MjAxMy0xMi0xMCAwNjoyMzo1Ny4w)

Construction of Manufactured Parts

Depending on how much design and your resources you can start building parts. There are many ways to do things, hand tools (jigsaw, hammer, etc), Manual mill lathe, full cnc; Which ever method you choose Make sure you are Safe.  
  
If you are building a budget robot you will most likely be using hand tools or light power tools. This is the method used by more bots than anything else. The only advise that I can offer for doing this is to take your time and use the templates or CAD drawings you created to help in the process. One of my preferred methods for this when I am unable to use the machine shop is to make drawings from CAD in a full scale and paste them to the material then use those guides to cut your parts.  
  
The next step up from manual tools is a standard machine shop. If you have access to a Mil or a lathe you will be able to create highly accurate parts. These tools can be very dangerous if you don't know what you are doing so make sure supervision or proper instruction happens before you start. If you are looking for access to a machine shops most towns and citys have them and you should be able to open a phone book and find someone to help. Sometimes they are willing to donate their time other times you will need to pay for their time. At this day in age there are some great resources online for manufacturing which can help you out. Sendcutsend.com or BigBlueSaw.com  
  
Advanced manufacturing can come into play for many complex robots. For my past few robots I have been fortunate to have access to CNC (computer numeric controlled) and waterjet for my bot parts. This makes building the components very easy but it makes the CAD design even more crucial for accuracy, as any machine shop will build EXACTLY what you give them. If you are going down this road make sure you take the extra steps to ensure that your design is right. I would even go as far to find someone else who knows CAD to review your designs to make sure you have not overlooked something.  

## Step 7: Assembly of Components

![Assembly of Components](https://content.instructables.com/F7C/46VF/FIJ3YDUL/F7C46VFFIJ3YDUL.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=525&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=MjAxMy0xMi0xMCAwNjoyMzo1Ny4w)

Assembly of Components

As you are in the process of building your components test fit your parts together. Don't be surprised if you have to modify some of them as they won't always fit. Depending on how they were manufactured your parts will fit together differently.  
  
Ones made in a machine shop or with a CNC will most likely go together as designed, the more manual the manufacturing the more modification you will need to do. Just make sure to use the montra of "measure twice cut once" as it is very hard to make material grow once you cut it away.  
  
The main advice in this process is don't get discouraged if you take your time things will go together just fine.  
  
Notes:  
if you are using threaded fasteners make sure to use high quality ones. The fasteners at the big box stores (home depot and lowes) are of low quality. I recommend ordering from McMaster Carr www.mcmaster.com or another industrial distributor.

## Step 9: Testing and Tweeking

Now that you have your robot mostly put together and wired you have reached the really fun part. TESTING.  
  
When doing this make sure you are properly protected and safe depending on the size of your robot and the weapons your robot may be lethal if not controlled properly.  
  
I like to test the subsystems separately before I test the bot all together. That way I can analyze problems to each component before having to backtrack the entire machine to find problems.  
  
Once your robot is complete make sure to drive your robot, getting a feel for the controls, many matches have been won or lost just because of driving skill. The more you test before your competition the better prepared you will be. I try to break my robots before the event as I would rather figure out mistakes and fix problems when I have time to fix them rather than the time in between the match.  
  
Another advantage to running your machine is "break in period" Every new gearbox or mechanical component will have to wear in a bit and will loosen up. You want to try and get everything broken in before your first competition so you are not dealing with changing robot conditions throughout the day.  
  
Ultimately It is important to remember that Design is an iterative process. You will never get it right the first time but with testing and modifications you can make it work.    

## Step 10: Enjoy Your Robot

![Enjoy Your Robot](https://content.instructables.com/FMR/399S/FIJ3YDVS/FMR399SFIJ3YDVS.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=933&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=MjAxMy0xMi0xMCAwNjoyMzo1OC4w)

Enjoy Your Robot

Now that you have built a robot make sure to have fun with it. Take it to competition and try to do your best, remember that it isn't necessary that you win every match or event as building the machine is 75%+ the fun of the project. Every robot you build will be a little bit better than the last, and use them to improve your skills as a designer and engineer.

## Step 11: Evaluation of My Robot

![Evaluation of My Robot](https://content.instructables.com/F30/9YPC/FIJ3YDVR/F309YPCFIJ3YDVR.jpg?auto=webp&frame=1&width=933&height=1024&fit=bounds&md=MjAxMy0xMi0xMCAwNjoyMzo1OC4w)

Evaluation of My Robot

As you may be wondering at this point about how my robot did in competition this page is a review of the design and performance. At the competition I was I did not win a single match, although they mostly went to split decision. This was due to a major design oversight.  
  
I made the decision to put the spinning blade in the middle of the robot with 2 wedges leading up to it. I did this because of the problems other vertical spinning robots have had with side impacts on their exposed blades. When a spinning blade is hit from the side significant damage is done not only to the blade but to the entire subsystem.  
  
The other major factor is the gyroscopic effect. When a blade spins it wants to keep the mass of the robot going in the same direction. This is amplified by the fact that the blade is off centered. By placing my blade in the center the gyroscopic effect was minimal.  
  
The flaw in my design came from the skirts which lead into my wedges. I used light polycarbonate instead of spring steel. In the first match these skirts got damaged and I didn't have replacements. This diminished my ability to get under competitors rendering my blade useless.  
  
If I were to do this again I would either replace the skirts with spring steel or remove a wedge all together and have an exposed blade. I feel that the risk of having a fatal hit on my blade would be worth being able to use my weapon.  
  
I would change my batteries from SLA to NiCad to gain a few extra lbs and increase the size of my weapon motor. I also used.5" aluminum for the sizes and.25" for the base. I realized this is way overkill for this size machine and I could loose some more weight off the system by optimizing.  
  
I am still happy with the result of this project as it challenged me in lots of ways. The other thing is I pride myself in is building robots unlike others. For better or worse my machine was different and I enjoy knowing that my idea was new into the world.  
  
Enjoy.
