## BattleBots & Choosing the Right Materials

Written by **[Leanne Cushing](https://www.onlinemetals.com/en/#aa)**

**[BattleBots:](https://battlebots.com/)** it’s exactly what it sounds like! Two 250lb robots enter the BattleBox in head-to-head robot-smashing combat, and one exits. Featured on the Discovery Channel and now well into its sixth season, BattleBots brings over sixty teams from all over the world to fight for the glory of the championship title. The competition attracts engineers and makers from a wide range of backgrounds, bringing a huge variety to the sport.  
  
With blades that reach tip speeds of 250 MPH, flippers that can toss Bots 16 feet in the air, crushers that can exert 100,000 lbs. of deadly force, and more, each team faces an incredible engineering challenge. Robots must be designed to both deliver blows powerful enough to disable opposing robots and be able to take blows without faltering as well. The high-energy hits can stun a robot’s electrical system, dismount components from its frame, or shred off armor if it isn’t strong enough, and the wrong material choice can lead to mid-fight failures that can cost you the match. With teams having to repair robots on-site before their next fight, a solid design paired with smart material selection is not only the ticket to strong performance during a fight but also can prevent hours of work in the pits to repair or rework elements of the robot for the next match.  
  
This season, Team Valkyrie has partnered with Online Metals to access high-quality, affordable materials during our build process. Read on to learn about why material selection is so critical to BattleBots, and how the team chooses materials when designing Valkyrie.
