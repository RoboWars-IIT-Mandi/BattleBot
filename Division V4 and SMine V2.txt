If you have issues opening a file we may be able to provide some limited support. However keep in mind these files are being given away for free with no assembly or manufacturing instructions, so we cannot answer dozens of lengthy questions about the design, wiring, or build process for these bots. These are for educational purposes only. You may build exact copies of the designs if you wish but you cannot keep the same/similar name and appearance as the originals.
